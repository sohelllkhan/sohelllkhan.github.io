title: " Lina always told me she will leave me "
---

I dont know why she always thought about separation between us.
Yes, it is true I did not deserve her love because I am not that person 
what she thought about me. I am not white, I do not live in London. 
My name is not Aaron. and I am not same age as her. We have 12 years difference.
I really love her but I always wanted to forget about me because in real me, 
she would not love me.. and it happended what I thought. when she found out my
reality, she left me. I dreamt when we met that oneday she will leave mee and now 
I am suffering a lot. why she is punishing me at this way.
I am still waiting for her because my gut feelings always says me Oneday She will come back.
I am waiting for her call, her texts...
I love you Lina..
I love you Lily.
